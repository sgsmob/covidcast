# Delphi Then

- In 2012, we formed [Delphi](https://delphi.cmu.edu) to "develop the theory and practice of epidemic forecasting, and its role in decision-making"
- Participated in annual CDC flu forecasting challenges since 2013, earned top place in several 
- Awarded `r col("CDC's National Center of Excellence")` for flu forecasting in 2019 
- Published open code and data, including numerous influenza surveillance streams 

# Delphi Now

- We've gone from 7 members to over 40, to support the US COVID-19 response
- Added many smart folks from CMU, but also Stanford, UC Davis, USC, Google
- Beyond (before?) forecasting: we've been focusing, now more than ever, on `r col("data")`
- *This problem is so hard that our best weapon is a diversity of data sources*

# COVIDcast Indicators

# This Talk

We can't cover all of this! We'll focus on our API, and some basic demos with our survey data (please ask about `r col("medical claims data")`, or ask about forecasting or nowcasting, during the Q and A)

Outline:

1. COVIDcast API
2. Symptom survey
3. Forecasting demo

# COVIDcast API 

The COVIDcast API is based on HTTP GET queries and returns data in JSON form. The base URL is https://api.covidcast.cmu.edu/epidata/api.php?source=covidcast 

| Parameter | Description | Examples |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `data_source` | data source | `doctor-visits` or `fb-survey` |
| `signal` | signal derived from data source | `smoothed_cli` or `smoothed_adj_cli` |
| `time_type` | temporal resolution of the signal | `day` or `week` |
| `geo_type` | spatial resolution of the signal | `county`, `hrr`, `msa`, or `state` |
| `time_values` | time units over which events happened | `20200406` or `20200406-20200410` |
| `geo_value` | location codes, depending on `geo_type` | `*` for all, or `pa` for Pennsylvania |

# R and Python Packages

We also provide [R](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/) and [Python](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/) packages for API access. Highlights: 

- Easy API querying:
    * Same specification structure (many default parameters) 
    * Full support for data revisions (as of, issues, lag)
- Basic signal processing:
    * Correlations sliced by location, or by time
    * Data wrangling: preparing signals for analysis
- Plotting functionality:
    * Choropleth and bubble maps 
    * Time series plots

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
sympt = covidcast_signal(data_source = "fb-survey", 
                         signal = "smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli",

# As Of, Issues, Lag

By default the API returns the most recent data for each `time_value`. We also provide access to all previous versions of the data, using the following optional parameters:

| Parameter | To get data ... | Examples |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `as_of` | as if we queried the API on a particular date | `20200406` |
| `issues` | published at a particular date or date range | `20200406` or `20200406-20200410` |
| `lag` | published a certain number of time units after events occured | `1` or `3` |

# Data Revisions 

Why would we need this? Because many data sources are subject to `r col("revisions:")`

- Case and death counts frequently corrected/adjusted by authorities
- Medical claims data can take weeks to be submitted and/or processed
- Testing/lab data can be backlogged for a variety of reasons, etc.

This presents a challenge to modelers: e.g., we have to learn how to forecast based on the `r col("data we'd have at the time")`, not updates that would arrive later

To accommodate, we log revisions even when the original data source does not!

# Example: Backfill in Doctor's Visits

The last two weeks of August in CA ...

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}
# Let's get the data that was available as of 09/22, for the end of August in CA

**Part 2: Symptom Surveys** </div>

# Massive Symptom Survey

Through recruitment partnership with Facebook, we survey about `r col("50,000 people daily")` (and over 14 million since it began in April), in the United States about:

- COVID symptoms (common and rare)
- COVID testing
- Mental health
- Social contacts and behavior
- Demographics

A [parallel, international effort](https://covidmap.umd.edu/) by the University of Maryland reaches 100+ countries in 55 languages

# Massive Symptom Survey (Cont.)

- The survey is implemented on Qualtrics, managed by CMU
- Facebook never receives any individual responses
- Designed to take about 10 minutes; about 35 questions
- Questions selected for relevance to forecasting and nowcasting
- But also for research in public health (understanding the pandemic burden)
- Respondents provide ZIP code, so data is available at county level

This is the largest non-Census research survey `r col("ever conducted")` (that we know of). Raw response data is freely available to researchers who sign a [data use agreement](https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/)

# COVID-Like Illness

Using the survey data we generate daily, county-level estimates of:

- `r col("% CLI:")` the percentage of people with COVID-like illness
- `r col("% CLI-in-community:")` the percentage of people who know someone in their local community with COVID-like illness

(Note that COVID-like illness or CLI is defined as *fever of at least 100 °F, along with cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing*. We also ask people to report on more rare symptoms)

# Why % CLI-in-Community? 

Why ask a proxy question (have people report on others)? Here's Spearman correlations to COVID-19 case rates (sliced by time): 

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
# Fetch Facebook % CLI signal, % CLI-in-community signal and confirmed case
# incidence proportions
start_day = "2020-04-15"
end_day = "2020-12-15"
sympt1 = covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_cli", 
                          start_day, end_day)
sympt2 = covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli", 
                          start_day, end_day)
cases = covidcast_signal("usa-facts", "confirmed_7dav_incidence_prop", 
                         start_day, end_day)

# Consider only counties with at least 500 cumulative cases so far
case_num = 500
geo_values = covidcast_signal("usa-facts", "confirmed_cumulative_num",
                              max(cases$time), max(cases$time)) %>%
  filter(value >= case_num) %>% pull(geo_value)
sympt1_act = sympt1 %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)
sympt2_act = sympt2 %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)
cases_act = cases %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)

# Compute correlations, per time, over all counties
df_cor1 = covidcast_cor(sympt1_act, cases_act, by = "time_value", 
                        method = "spearman")
df_cor2 = covidcast_cor(sympt2_act, cases_act, by = "time_value", 
                        method = "spearman")

# Stack rowwise into one data frame
df_cor = rbind(df_cor1, df_cor2)
df_cor$signal = c(rep("% CLI", nrow(df_cor1)), 
                  rep("% CLI-in-community", nrow(df_cor2)))

# Then plot correlations over time 
ggplot(df_cor, aes(x = time_value, y = value)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = signal)) +
  labs(title = "Correlation between survey signals and case rates (by time)",
       subtitle = sprintf("Over all counties with at least %i cumulative cases",

    theme_bw() + theme(legend.pos = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
```

# Beyond Symptom Data

Reminder: survey data extends far beyond symptoms. For example:

- Test positivity rate, broken down by test reason
- % of people tested in last 14 days, broken down by age, occupation
- % of people *ever* tested
- Types of activities people do outside their homes
- Mask wearing, reporting on self/others in community
- Anxiety, depression, isolation

# Example: Mask Use in Others

Interesting discrepancy in reported use by self versus others ... but not unexpected?

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
start_day = "2020-12-01"
end_day = "2020-12-01"

# An Early Indicator? (Cont.) 

Let's look again, now at Allegheny County, right around the third wave:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
start_day = "2020-10-15"
end_day = "2020-12-01"
sympt = covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli", 
                         start_day, end_day)
cases = covidcast_signal("usa-facts", "confirmed_7dav_incidence_num",
                         start_day, end_day)

# Produce a plot for Allegheny County, and add vertical lines
plot_one(name_to_fips("Allegheny"), df1 = sympt, df2 = cases,
         lab1 = "% CLI-in-community", lab2 = "New COVID-19 cases", 
         xlab = "Date", ylab1 = "New COVID-19 cases",
         ylab2 = "% of people who know someone with CLI") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2020-10-30")),
             linetype = 2, size = 1, color = ggplot_colors[1]) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2020-11-06")),
             linetype = 2, size = 1, color = ggplot_colors[2])
```

# An Early Indicator? (Cont.) 

Once more, still Allegheny County, now % of doctor visits with CLI:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
dv = covidcast_signal("chng", "smoothed_adj_outpatient_cli", 
                      start_day, end_day)

# Produce a plot for Allegheny County, and add vertical lines
plot_one(name_to_fips("Allegheny"), df1 = dv, df2 = cases,
         lab1 = "% CLI-in-doctor-visits", lab2 = "New COVID-19 cases", 
         xlab = "Date", ylab1 = "New COVID-19 cases",
         ylab2 = "% of people who know someone with CLI") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2020-11-02")),
             linetype = 2, size = 1, color = ggplot_colors[1]) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2020-11-06")),
             linetype = 2, size = 1, color = ggplot_colors[2])
```

# Simple Forecasting Demo

Notational setup: for location (county) $\ell$ and time (day) $t$, let

- $Y_{\ell,t}$ denote the COVID-19 case incidence rate,
- $X_{\ell,t}$ the % CLI-in-community or % CLI-in-doctor-visits signal. 

To predict case rates $d$ days ahead, consider two simple models:
$$
\begin{align*}
& h(Y_{\ell,t+d}) \approx \alpha + \sum_{j=0}^2 \beta_j h(Y_{\ell,t-7j}) 
\quad \text{(Cases)} \\
& h(Y_{\ell,t+d}) \approx \alpha + \sum_{j=0}^2 \beta_j h(Y_{\ell,t-7j}) +
\sum_{j=0}^2 \gamma_j h(X_{\ell,t-7j}) 
\quad \text{(Cases + signal)} \\
\end{align*}
$$

For each forecast date, we train models on the most recent 14 days worth of data (setup adapted from [this blog post](https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/09/21/can-symptoms-surveys-improve-covid-19-forecasts/))

# Wrapping Up

Delphi's COVIDcast ecosystem has many parts:

1. Unique relationships with partners in tech and healthcare granting us access to data on pandemic activity
2. Code and infrastructure to build `r col("COVID-19 indicators")`, continuously-updated and geographically-comprehensive
3. A historical database of all indicators, including `r col("revision tracking")`
4. A [public API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html) (and [R](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/) and [Python](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/) packages) serving new indicators daily 
5. [Interactive maps and graphics](https://covidcast.cmu.edu) to display our indicators
6. `r col("Nowcasting and forecasting")` work building on the indicators

In this pandemic, it'll take an entire community to find answers to all the important questions. Please join ours!
